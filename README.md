# tiktoklady

it makes me laugh, so this is a small cmd line tool for interacting with it.

## usage

You can run it with `node index.js "your text" somefile.mp3`

but it's nicer with an alias in yr `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` like this: 

```
alias tiktoklady="node ~/path/to/tiktoklady/index.js $1 $2"
```

## license

i guess wutever node-fetch is
